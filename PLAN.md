**Phase 4 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — CI gate verified on real Trackdub commits.

---

---

## Phase 5 — Near-Term Enablers + Documentation Backfill

**Done means:** DESIGN.md fully answered; `--frameworks` config works on real
Trackdub; disk cache eliminates redundant re-extraction on repeated CLI runs.

---

## Phase 6 — Second Language Parser (Spring)

**Done means:** A Spring Boot project produces a valid IR graph. DUPLICATE and
LEAKED detection work on a real Spring Boot repo with multiple framework contexts.

| Task | Status | Notes |

**Phase 6 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — Spring PetClinic IR contains ≥10 singleton nodes,
@Autowired wiring edges present; Spring Data repos show DEGRADED confidence.

---

## Phase 7 — IDE Extension (deferred)

**Status:** Deferred until after Phase 8/9. CLI-first delivery remains the primary
form factor (ADR-003). IDE extension is a thin consumer once fix + analysis stabilize.

**Done means:** A VS Code extension shows inline error badges on DI registration
call sites without leaving the editor.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ADR-006: IDE integration form factor | ⬜ Deferred | After Phase 8/9 |
| Extension scaffold | ⬜ Deferred | |
| On-save analysis trigger | ⬜ Deferred | |
| Inline diagnostic decorations (LEAKED, BROKEN, DUPLICATE) | ⬜ Deferred | |
| IR cache reuse within IDE session | ⬜ Deferred | |
| Phase 7 verification | ⬜ Deferred | Inline badge on Trackdub without CLI |

**Phase 7 gate:** LEAKED badge appears inline within 5 seconds of opening
Trackdub in VS Code; no false positive on clean commit.

---

## Phase 8 — Auto-fix / Codemod

**Done means:** `dcs fix` applies at least one safe fix class (DUPLICATE
removal) with a preview diff and rollback via git.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ADR-007: Write-back safety model | ✅ Done | 2026-06-29 — Accepted; DUPLICATE-only v1 |
| DCS.Fix — DUPLICATE removal | ✅ Done | 2026-06-29 — Roslyn statement removal + preview/apply |
| CLI `dcs fix` | ✅ Done | 2026-06-29 — `--preview` default, `--apply`, `--token`, `--force` |
| Fix classes: ORPHANED removal | ⬜ Deferred | v1.1 after false-positive measurement |
| Fix classes: LEAKED (add framework guard) | ⬜ Deferred | |
| Phase 8 verification | ✅ Done | 2026-06-29 — Fixture + Trackdub optional gate |

**Phase 8 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — `dcs fix --apply` removes one DUPLICATE registration;
preview diff shows only the removed line; analyze shows one fewer duplicate group.

---

## Phase 9 — Runtime Enrichment Overlay

**Done means:** A dev-mode instrumented run annotates the static graph with
which types were actually resolved and whether any lifetime violations fired.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ADR-008: Runtime instrumentation approach | ✅ Accepted | DiagnosticSource + JSONL file log; merge via `dcs enrich` |
| Runtime collector — implement | ✅ Done | `DcsRuntimeEventListener`, `RuntimeLogWriter` |
| Static+runtime graph merge | ✅ Done | `RuntimeGraphEnricher` — annotations, blind-spot upgrade, orphaned reclassification |
| Lifetime violation detection (scoped-inside-singleton) | ✅ Done | `CaptiveDependencyFinding` from caller_lifetime + lifetime |
| CLI `dcs enrich` | ✅ Done | `--runtime-log`, `--out`, optional `--frameworks` / `--root` |
| Unit tests | ✅ Done | `DCS.Runtime.Tests`, `EnrichCommandTests` |
| Phase 9 verification | ✅ Done | 2026-07-01 — Trackdub @ pin: 299/335 annotated (89.3%); fixture `runtime-3c4e374d.jsonl`; 0 orphaned at pin |

**Phase 9 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — runtime-annotated IR contains `runtime_resolved_count`; ≥50% nodes annotated on Trackdub aggregate graph; orphan reclassification N/A (0 orphaned at pin).

---

## Phase 10 — Semantic Roslyn Type Resolution

**Done means:** Per-project semantic compilation resolves registration and constructor
types; strict DUPLICATE uses `DuplicateGroupKey`; Trackdub CI gate passes at pin
`3c4e374d`.

**Phase 10 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — `trackdub-semantic` CI green on main (merge `4644863`); metrics at pin `3c4e374d23fe3941ed7ca376775937941973b313`: semantic 54.4%, API verification 100%, scope completeness 100%; VoiceCloneConsentCoordinator possible duplicate with file:line sites.

---

## Phase 10b — Actionable CLI

**Done means:** Structured analysis report with tiered findings, enriched text output,
generalized `FindingPolicy`, parser 0.3.0 instance + shallow factory patterns, and
fixture/Trackdub gates asserting file:line sites.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `AnalysisReport` + builder + printer | ✅ Done | Tiers, sites, summary |
| CLI flags (`--verbosity`, `--strict`, `--format json`, etc.) | ✅ Done | |

**CI contributor note:** The `trackdub-semantic` job checks out the private Trackdub repo at pin `3c4e374d23fe3941ed7ca376775937941973b313` into `dcs-trackdub-pin/` (gitignored locally). Add a GitHub repository secret `TRACKDUB_PAT` with a PAT that can read `tonythethompson/Trackdub`. Locally, set `TRACKDUB_PATH` to your Trackdub clone (see `.claude/settings.local.json`) or clone into `dcs-trackdub-pin/` at the pin SHA.

---

## Phase 11 — Parser fidelity and ground-truth hardening

**Done means:** Trackdub @ pin shows measurably better extraction quality; Avalonia
shell `MainWindow` block factory is recognised (not `unrecognized_pattern`); gate
floors raised from Phase 10c baseline; technical debt cleaned.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Investigate `app.axaml.cs` shell composition blind spots | ✅ Done | Root cause: block-bodied `AddSingleton(sp => { return new MainWindow(...); })` |
| `ShallowFactoryLambdaExtractor` block-lambda support | ✅ Done | Parser 0.3.1 |
| Fixture regression (`DiPatternRegistrations` + unit tests) | ✅ Done | Block factory lambda tests |

| Phase 11 Verified (Trackdub metrics) | ✅ Done | 2026-06-30 — 54.6% / 100% / 100% (335 nodes, 6 scopes); MainWindow shallow factory registered |

**Phase 11 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — `dotnet test` green; Trackdub @ pin `3c4e374d23fe3941ed7ca376775937941973b313`: semantic 54.6% (+0.2pp vs Phase 10c baseline 54.4%), API verification 100%, scope completeness 100%; Avalonia `MainWindow` block factory recognised as `factory_lambda_shallow` (not `unrecognized_pattern`); VoiceClone file:line assertions unchanged. **Aspirational +5pp semantic target (~59.4%) deferred** — remaining blind spots are mostly `factory_lambda` / `factory_lambda_shallow` at other sites, not shell composition.

---

## Phase 12 — Semantic resolution hardening (windows TFM + factory deps)

**Done means:** Windows TFM semantic cliff closed via cross-TFM project-reference compilation
closure; factory-lambda `GetRequiredService` deps traced; aggregate + per-context gate floors raised.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Investigate windows TFM semantic cliff (15.9% vs 91.8% portable) | ✅ Done | Root cause: portable-only deps not compiled into windows TFM graph |

| Per-context gate metrics + raised floors (57% aggregate, 40% windows) | ✅ Done | Actual: 91.6% aggregate, 91.5% windows |
| Phase 12 Verified (Trackdub metrics) | ✅ Done | 2026-06-30 — 91.6% / 100% / 100% (335 nodes, 6 scopes) |

**Phase 12 gate:** ✅ CLOSED — `dotnet test` green; Trackdub @ pin: aggregate semantic **91.6%**, windows TFM **91.5%**, portable **91.8%**; MainWindow + VoiceClone assertions unchanged; cross-TFM compilation closure verified via `CrossTfmProjectReferenceResolverTests`.

---

## Phase 13 — Path Excavator MVP

**Done means:** `dcs path` answers dependency paths on extracted graphs; Trackdub gate
confirms path to Avalonia shell registration; semantic floors locked at Phase 12 levels.

| Sidebar path panel in HTML | ✅ Done | Hop list |
| Unit tests (`HtmlVizPathHighlightTests`) | ✅ Done | |
| DESIGN.md §12 Path Excavator update | ✅ Done | Viz highlight shipped |

**Phase 13b gate:** ✅ CLOSED — `dotnet test` green; HTML embeds `PATH_HIGHLIGHT` payload matching `dcs path` node/edge ids.

---

## Phase 8.1a — ORPHANED measurement + preview-only fix

**Done means:** `dcs fix --fix-class orphaned --preview` reports FP measurement and unified diff; `--apply` rejected until ADR-007 amendment.

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `OrphanedFixMeasurement` report | ✅ Done | total / explicit / eligible counts |
| `OrphanedFixPlanner` (explicit, non-root, non-infra) | ✅ Done | Composition root excluded |
